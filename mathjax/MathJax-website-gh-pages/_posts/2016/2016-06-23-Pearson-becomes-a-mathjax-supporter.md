[Pearson](http://www.pearson.com) is giving the MathJax project a boost by joining our sponsorship program as [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

Founded in 1844 as a small building firm in Yorkshire, Pearson is the largest education company in the world today. With [Pearson School](http://www.pearsonschool.com/), [Pearson Higher Education](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/) and [Pearson Professional](http://www.pearsoned.com/professional/), Pearson's focus today lies solely on education.

"Pearson is proud to become a MathJax sponsor as we often rely on MathJax to deliver our web-based math and science assessment and instructional content in our digital products.", says Wayne Ostler, VP Content Systems and Publishing. "We look forward to working with the MathJax community to develop and improve MathML rendering and accessibility tools in our digital products".

“The support as a MathJax sponsor demonstrates Pearson's commitment to being a partner to the math and science community on the web”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Becoming a MathJax Supporter allows Pearson to make optimal use of MathJax, and makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible, and open technology it is today.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with Pearson, and welcomes their support for the MathJax project.

MathJax was initiated in 2009 by the [American Mathematical Society (AMS)](http://www.ams.org),  [Design Science](http://www.dessci.com), and the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](http://www.siam.org) with the aim of developing a universal, robust, and easy-to-use solution to display mathematics on the web. MathJax's open source JavaScript library provides high-quality display on all browsers and platforms without the need for readers to install plugins or fonts. Using MathJax also enables copy&paste of equations and is compatible with accessibility tools for vision and learning disabilities. The MathJax Consortium is supported by numerous sponsors.
