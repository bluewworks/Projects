MathJax today announced that [EBSCO Information Services](http://www.ebsco.com) (EBSCO) is joining its sponsorship program as a [MathJax Supporter](//www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

EBSCO provides premium online information resources for tens of thousands of institutions worldwide, representing millions of end users. EBSCO content and its platforms serve the needs of researchers at all levels, including academic institutions, schools, public libraries, hospitals and medical institutions, corporations or government institutions. Its participation in the sponsorship program is just one way that EBSCO is involved with MathJax. EBSCO also uses MathJax to ensure that the mathematical equations are optimally displayed when they appear in its research databases.

“As a MathJax sponsor, EBSCO demonstrates its partnership to the science community on the web”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Becoming a MathJax Supporter allows EBSCO to make optimal use of MathJax, and makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible, and open technology it is today.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with EBSCO, and welcomes its support for the MathJax project.
