MathJax today announced that [PLOS](http://www.plos.org) (Public Library of Science) continues to support the MathJax project as a [MathJax Supporter](//www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

PLOS is a nonprofit publisher and advocacy organization founded to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. Since 2003, PLOS has launched innovative publications like PLOS ONE, PLOS Collections, and PLOS Currents. PLOS works to overcome unnecessary barriers to immediate availability of research, to optimize the quality and integrity of the publication process, and to develop innovative approaches to the assessment, organization and reuse of ideas and data.

“PLOS’ continued support of MathJax demonstrates our commitment to our authors and readers,” said CJ Rayhill, Chief Technology Officer for PLOS. “MathJax’s cutting edge, open source platform enables authors to effortlessly include complex mathematical equations in the research they publish with PLOS while also providing readers with high-quality displays of that work, making figures and equations easier to interpret and reuse.”

“As a MathJax sponsor, PLOS demonstrates its commitment to being a partner to the science community on the web,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax Manager. “The feedback from the team at PLOS enables us to keep MathJax the robust, high-quality rendering solution it is today.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with PLOS, and welcomes their support for the MathJax project.
