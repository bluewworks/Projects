[Cambridge University Press](http://cambridge.org) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

With its first publication dating back to 1584, Cambridge University Press (CUP) is the oldest publishing house in the world. As part of the University of Cambridge. CUP follows the University's mission to disseminate knowledge in the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence. Today, CUP publishes 50,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries with platforms such as [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core) leveraging MathJax to deliver high-quality, accessible mathematics in over 300 peer-reviewed journals.

"Cambridge University Press's new content platform, Cambridge Core, brings together our digital books and journal in site specifically designed with researchers in mind," says Chris Fell, Director of Digital Strategy and Partnerships at Cambridge University Press. "We are very pleased to work with MathJax to ensure the optimal presentation of our [maths content in Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/browse-subjects/mathematics)."

“Thanks to dedicated sponsors like CUP, we are able to develop MathJax continuously,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “We are very grateful for their continued support as it allows us to keep MathJax the universal, high-quality rendering solution it is today”.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with CUP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
