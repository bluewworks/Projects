MathWorks provides the fundamental tools for research and development in academia and industry. Its leading computing software products, [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and [Simulink](http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/), help engineers and scientists worldwide to accelerate the pace of discovery, innovation, and development. From industries, such as aerospace and industrial automation, to technical fields, such as financial services and computational biology, to more than 5000 colleges and universities around the world, the tools support teaching and research in a broad range of technical disciplines.

“MathJax plays an integral role in advancing mathematical and scientific content on the web by removing barriers for people and supporting easy access to learning,” said Mary Ann Freeman, director of engineering, MATLAB Products, MathWorks. “We are proud to once again support MathJax’s mission of providing easy access to learning mathematics – a goal that MathWorks shares.”

"Dedicated sponsors like MathWorks help ensure the long-term development of MathJax”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Thanks to the feedback from MathWorks we can keep MathJax the robust and high-quality rendering solution it is today."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with MathWorks and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
