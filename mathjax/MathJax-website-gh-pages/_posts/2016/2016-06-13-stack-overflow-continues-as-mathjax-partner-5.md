[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Partner.

Stack Exchange's ever-growing network of online communities provides dedicated platforms that serve experts in a specific field. Among the 143 Stack Exchange sites, 29 integrate MathJax support to provide easy authoring and flawless rendering of mathematical content, including [Mathematics Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com) and [Physics Stack Exchange](http://physics.stackexchange.com) as well as new communities such as [History of Math and Science Stack Exchange](http://hsm.stackexchange.com/) and [Worldbuilding Stack Exchange](http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/).

"We're thrilled to continue our partnership with MathJax. MathJax is a vital tool for our math, tech, and science communities, and partnering with MathJax helps improve it not only for ourselves but the entire worldwide mathematical community," said David Fullerton, Vice President of Engineering.​ "​We look forward to continuing to work with the MathJax team in the coming year."

"At MathJax, we benefit greatly from Stack Overflow's support both as a sponsor and as a community," comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "The rich feedback from their technical team is critical to our development and the highly diverse Stack Exchange communities help ensure that MathJax continues to be flexible, open, and robust."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Stack Exchange, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
