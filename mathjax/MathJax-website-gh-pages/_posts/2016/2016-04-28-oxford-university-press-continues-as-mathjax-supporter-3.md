[Oxford University Press](http://www.oup.com) (OUP) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

OUP, a department of [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), is the largest university press in the world, currently publishing over 6,000 titles in more than 40 languages each year. OUP's broad academic and educational spectrum includes dictionaries, journals, scholarly monographs, and schoolbooks. Beyond traditional publishing products, OUP provides services such as digital learning and assessment platforms as well as online research tools.

“Oxford University Press is very happy to renew its support of MathJax," said Richard O'Beirne, Digital Strategy Manager at OUP. "MathJax has become an essential plug-in for today’s research publishing platforms, and the MathJax Consortium do extremely valuable work for all in developing and pushing the boundaries of math rendering technology.”

"The team at OUP continues to provide important support and feedback for our development,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “The continued support of MathJax is a great example for OUP's commitment to providing the science community with reliable, flexible, and open technology on the web and beyond.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with OUP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
