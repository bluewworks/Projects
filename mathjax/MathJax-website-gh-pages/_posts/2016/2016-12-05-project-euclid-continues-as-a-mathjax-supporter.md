[Project Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Project Euclid is a not-for-profit online publishing service designed to address the unique needs of the fields of theoretical and applied mathematics and statistics by providing access to independent and society journals, monographs, and conference proceeding. Through a collaborative partnership arrangement, publishers join forces and participate in an online presence with advanced functionality, allowing them to better serve scholars without sacrificing their intellectual or economic independence or commitment to low subscription prices. Project Euclid is jointly managed by [Cornell University Library](https://www.library.cornell.edu/) and [Duke University Press](http://www.dukeupress.edu/).

"MathJax continues to be a transformative tool for Project Euclid," says Leslie Eager, Director of Publishing Services. "We frequently marvel at the online publishing solutions that MathJax makes possible for us and deeply appreciate its commitment to remaining free and easy-to-use for the whole mathematics community."

"The team at Project Euclid continues to provide important support and feedback for our development,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “The continued support of MathJax is a great example for Project Euclid's commitment to providing the science community with reliable, flexible, and open technology on the web and beyond.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the continued collaboration with Project Euclid, and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
