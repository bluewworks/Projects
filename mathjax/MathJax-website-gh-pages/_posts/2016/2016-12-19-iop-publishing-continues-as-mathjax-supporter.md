[IOP Publishing](http://ioppublishing.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

IOP Publishing is a subsidiary of the Institute of Physics, a leading scientific society promoting physics and bringing together around 50,000 physicists from all sectors worldwide. IOP Publishing provides a range of journals, ebooks, magazines, conference proceedings and websites for the scientific community. IOP Publishing combines the culture of a learned society with global reach and highly efficient and effective publishing systems and processes.

Dr Christopher Ingle, Content & Services Manager at IOP Publishing, said, "We are glad to be able to continue our support for the MathJax project. The technology continues to provide us with consistent, high-quality presentation of mathematical content for our HTML and EPUB formats, which would otherwise be impossible. We look forward to further developments in the coming year."

"IOP Publishing provides the team at MathJax with important support and feedback for our development,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “Thanks to long-term supporters like IOPP, we can keep MathJax the reliable, high-quality rendering solution it is today.”
