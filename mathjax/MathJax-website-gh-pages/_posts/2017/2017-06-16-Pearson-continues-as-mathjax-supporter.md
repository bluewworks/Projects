<!--# Pearson continues as MathJax Supporter-->

[Pearson](http://www.pearson.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

Founded in 1844 as a small building firm in Yorkshire, Pearson is the largest education company in the world today. With [Pearson School](http://www.pearsonschool.com/), [Pearson Higher Education](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/) and [Pearson Professional](http://www.pearsoned.com/professional/), Pearson's focus today lies solely on education.

"Pearson is proud to continue our sponsorship of MathJax. The use of MathJax in our digital assessment and instructional content continues to grow.", says Wayne Ostler, VP Content Systems and Publishing. "We look forward to continuing our work with the MathJax community to improve MathML rendering and accessibility in our digital products".

“Thanks to our dedicated sponsors like Pearson, we are able to develop MathJax continuously, keeping it the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Pearson's support and the input from its staff provide us with productive feedback that helps our development.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with Pearson, and welcomes their support for the MathJax project.

MathJax was initiated in 2009 by the [American Mathematical Society (AMS)](http://www.ams.org),  [Design Science](http://www.dessci.com), and the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](http://www.siam.org) with the aim of developing a universal, robust, and easy-to-use solution to display mathematics on the web. MathJax's open source JavaScript library provides high-quality display on all browsers and platforms without the need for readers to install plugins or fonts. Using MathJax also enables copy&paste of equations and is compatible with accessibility tools for vision and learning disabilities. The MathJax Consortium is supported by numerous sponsors.
