EBSCO provides premium online information resources for tens of thousands of institutions worldwide, representing millions of end users.

EBSCO Information Services Vice President of Database Partnerships, Ryan Bernier, said, “MathJax improves accessibility, readability and interpretation of equations on both desktop and mobile devices. As a provider of STEM e-journals and databases including MathSciNet, EBSCO is proud to support the development and enhancement of MathJax.”
