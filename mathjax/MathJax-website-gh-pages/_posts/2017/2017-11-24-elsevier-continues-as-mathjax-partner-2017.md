[Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Sponsor.

Elsevier is a world-leading provider of information solutions for science, health, and technology professionals. Elsevier provides web-based, digital solutions — among them ScienceDirect, Scopus, Elsevier Research Intelligence, and ClinicalKey — and publishes over 2,600 journals, including The Lancet and Cell, and more than 33,000 book titles, including a number of iconic reference works.  Elsevier is actively advancing discipline-specific content, format, and tools to the author and user needs and workflow.

“Elsevier is pleased to continue our support for the MathJax project. ScienceDirect has seen several new updates this year including a new article page design with MathJax as the default option for rendering mathematical elements,” said Nathan Westgarth, Senior Product Manager for ScienceDirect. “This improves accessibility, readability and interpretation on the site while using either desktop or mobile devices, for research published in Elsevier journals.”

"Elsevier's support and feedback has helped our development at MathJax since the very beginning.", said Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Thanks to Elsevier, we can ensure that MathJax stays the gold standard for math and science on the web."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Elsevier and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
