Literatum hosts more than 24 million articles and 130,00 eBooks, as well as many other types of scientific and scholarly content, for more than 200 publishers. 

“We’ve always believed that MathJax benefits the entire scholarly publishing community, and we’re pleased to extend our support,” said Georgios Papadopoulos, Atypon’s CEO and founder. “Literatum’s ability to accurately render MathJax objects enhances the quality our clients’ publications.”

“As a MathJax sponsor, Atypon demonstrates its commitment to being a partner to the science community on the web,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax Manager. “The feedback we receive from the team at Atypon helps ensure that MathJax remains the leading rendering solution for the web and beyond.”
