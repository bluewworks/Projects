CUP follows the University's mission to disseminate knowledge in the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence.

“Cambridge Core, Cambridge University Press’s new home of academic content, is committed to accelerating learning, knowledge and research, and has been widely praised for its user centric design.” says Chris Fell, Director of Digital Strategy and Partnerships at Cambridge University Press. "We are therefore very pleased to announce we will be continue to work with MathJax to ensure the optimal presentation of our maths content online for all our researchers."

“The support as a MathJax sponsor demonstrates CUP's commitment to being a partner to the math and science community on the web”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager.
