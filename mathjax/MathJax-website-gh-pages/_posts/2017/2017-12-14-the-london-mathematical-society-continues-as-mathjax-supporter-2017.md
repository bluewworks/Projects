The [London Mathematical Society](http://lms.ac.uk/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The London Mathematical Society (LMS) is the major UK learned society for mathematics with a nationwide and international membership. The LMS offers a rich publishing program, provides a diverse grant program, and organizes scientific meetings and lectures. Beyond that, the LMS  contributes to public debate on matters affecting mathematics and mathematics education.

"The London Mathematical Society leverages MathJax in the full-text HTML of its journals." said Fiona Nixon, Executive Secretary, LMS. "Feedback from our readers continues to be positive and we recognise that development needs to continue in the quest to render mathematical web pages with the same fluidity and versatility as non-mathematical ones. The LMS is therefore proud to continue to support the development and enhancement of MathJax".

“The support as a MathJax sponsor demonstrates the LMS's commitment to being a partner to the math and science community on the web”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "As a MathJax Supporter, the LMS makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible, and open technology it is today.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with the LMS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
