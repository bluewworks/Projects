[Springer Nature](http://www.springernature.com/) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Springer Nature is one of the world’s leading global research, educational and professional publishers. Formed in 2015 through the merger of Nature Publishing Group, Palgrave Macmillan, Macmillan Education and Springer Science+Business Media, Springer Nature is the world’s largest academic book publisher, publisher of the world’s most influential journals and a pioneer in the field of open research.

"The quality of our online publications relies on accurate display of mathematical content", says Springer Nature. "MathJax is critical to achieving this. We are pleased to continue our sponsorship of MathJax and engage with its team as well as a community dedicated to the advancement of mathematics on the web."

"At MathJax, we benefit from Springer Nature's support both as a sponsor and as a community," comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Thanks to Springer Nature's support and feedback we can keep MathJax the high-quality, robust, and flexible rendering solution it is today."


The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with Springer and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
