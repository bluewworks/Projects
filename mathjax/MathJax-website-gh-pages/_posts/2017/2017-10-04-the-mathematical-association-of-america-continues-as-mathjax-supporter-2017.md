[The Mathematical Association of America (MAA)](http://www.maa.org/?utm_source=MathJax&utm_campaign=MJpartner&utm_medium=website) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The [MAA](http://www.maa.org/?utm_source=MathJax&utm_campaign=MJpartner&utm_medium=website) is the world’s largest community of mathematicians, students, and enthusiasts. It accelerates the understanding of our world through mathematics because mathematics drives society and shapes lives.

"Effective and clear communication of mathematics is imperative to our association's mission to advance the understanding of mathematics and its impact on our world," said Michael Pearson, MAA Executive Director. "MathJax is an important tool to bring mathematical equations to life on the MAA website and digital resources, and we are happy to continue our support."

"Dedicated sponsors like the MAA help ensure the long-term development of MathJax”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax Manager. "Thanks to the feedback from the MAA we can keep MathJax the robust and high-quality tool that the math and science community has come to rely on."

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with the MAA and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
