The [American Physical Society](http://www.aps.org/) (APS) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Founded in 1899, the American Physical Society (APS) is the world's largest organization of physicists and involved in several activities to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics, including a strong publication program with landmark titles such as Physical Review Letters, the Physical Review journals, and Reviews of Modern Physics. As an influential supporter of SGML-based math notation in the 1990s and an early adopter of MathML, the APS has long been furthering innovation in academic communication.

"MathJax continues to be an essential component for rendering high-quality mathematics on the web. APS remains dedicated to supporting the significant improvements expected with MathJax 3.0 and appreciates the opportunity to contribute through our participation on the technical committee," said Mark Doyle, Chief Information Officer, American Physical Society. "Modernizing MathJax with new flexibility and control will help us to serve our readers well into the future."

“Thanks to dedicated sponsors like APS, we are able to develop MathJax continuously,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “We are very grateful for their continued support as it allows us to keep MathJax the universal, high-quality rendering solution it is today”.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with APS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
