[IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Partner.

With roots going back to 1884, IEEE is the world’s largest professional association with over 2,000 local chapters across the world. IEEE follows its mission to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.  With more than 148 transactions, journals, and magazines as well as sponsoring for over 1,300 conferences, IEEE inspires as global community in electrical engineering, computer science and electronics. Its [_IEEEXplore®_ digital library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) provides web access to over three million technical documents with more than eight million downloads each month.

"IEEE has enthusiastically supported the development of Mathjax since 2013" said Gerry Grenier, IEEE Senior Director of Publishing Technologies. "The tool has become an invaluable, irreplaceable part of our publishing ecosystem -- facilitating inexpensive and unmatched quality in online presentation of math for our highly selective engineering journals. There is no better solution to math-on-the web."

"At MathJax, we benefit greatly from IEEE's support both as a sponsor and as a community," comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "The rich feedback from their technical team is critical to our development and the highly diverse IEEE communities help ensure that MathJax continues to be flexible, open, and robust."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IEEE, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
