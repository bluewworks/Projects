[IOP Publishing](http://ioppublishing.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

IOP Publishing is a scientific publisher, owned by the [Institute of Physics](http://www.iop.org/). It works closely with the whole scientific community to produce academic journals and other publications, covering research in the physical sciences and beyond.

Dr Christopher Ingle, Content & Services Manager at IOP Publishing, said, "The development of version 3 makes this an exciting time for MathJax, and therefore an exciting time in general for the display of mathematics online. We are delighted to continue as supporters of the project."

“Thanks to the dedication of sponsors like IOPP, we are able to maintain and enhance MathJax as the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "The feedback we receive from the team at IOPP is invaluable in achieving our mission to make mathematics a first class citizen on the web.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IOP Publishing, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
