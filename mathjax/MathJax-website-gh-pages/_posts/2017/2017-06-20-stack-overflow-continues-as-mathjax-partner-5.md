[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Partner. Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online developer community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities.

Stack Overflow operates the Stack Exchange network, an ever-growing network of online communities provides dedicated platforms that serve experts in a specific field. Among the 143 Stack Exchange sites, 29 integrate MathJax support to provide easy authoring and flawless rendering of mathematical content, including [Mathematics Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com) and [Physics Stack Exchange](http://physics.stackexchange.com) as well as newer communities such as [History of Science and Mathematics Stack Exchange](http://hsm.stackexchange.com/) and [Worldbuilding Stack Exchange](http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/).


"MathJax has been an essential partner of Stack Overflow for the past 6 years. Our partnership with MathJax allows us to continue to improve MathJax to serve not only our own math, tech and science communities, but also the entire worldwide mathematical community," said David Fullerton, CTO at Stack Overflow. "We look forward to continuing to work with the MathJax team in the coming year."

“Dedicated sponsors like Stack Overflow help us ensure the continuous development of MathJax”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “The diverse Stack Exchange communities and the rich feedback from their technical team is critical to our development so that MathJax continues to be flexible, open, and robust.”


We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Stack Overflow, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
