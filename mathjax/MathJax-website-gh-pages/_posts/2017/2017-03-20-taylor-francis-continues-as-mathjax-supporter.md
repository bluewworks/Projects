Taylor &amp; Francis, a division of [Informa plc](http://www.informa.com/), is a leading international academic publisher with more than 1,800 journals, over 2,000 new books each year, and a books backlist in excess of 50,000 specialist titles. Access to all journals from Taylor &amp; Francis, Routledge and Psychology Press is provided by T&F's state-of-the art platform [Taylor &amp; Francis Online](http://tandfonline.com) where MathJax provides beautiful, accessible mathematics in publications such as the journals of the [American Statistical Association](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/).

Richard Steele, Editorial Director for Mathematics & Statistics at Taylor & Francis, noted “Taylor & Francis finds MathJax creates simple, elegant, and beautiful solutions – and we are proud to be a supporter since 2014.”

“Thanks to the dedication of sponsors like Taylor &amp; Francis, we are able to maintain and enhance MathJax as the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "The feedback we receive from the team at Taylor &amp; Francis is invaluable in achieving our mission to make mathematics a first class citizen on the web.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Taylor & Francis, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
