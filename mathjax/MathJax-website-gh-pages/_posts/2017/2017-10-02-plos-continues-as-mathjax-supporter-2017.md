MathJax today announced that [PLOS](http://www.plos.org) (Public Library of Science) continues to support the MathJax project as a [MathJax Supporter](//www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

PLOS is a nonprofit publisher and advocacy organization founded to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. Since 2003, PLOS has launched innovative publications like PLOS ONE, PLOS Collections, and PLOS Currents. PLOS works to overcome unnecessary barriers to immediate availability of research, to optimize the quality and integrity of the publication process, and to develop innovative approaches to the assessment, organization and reuse of ideas and data.

“As an Open Access publisher and advocacy organization, PLOS is committed to supporting open software and systems for solving the challenges of scholarly communication.  We are proud to be working with MathJax to further their efforts in providing authors with tools to include complex mathematical equations in their publications,” said Helen Atkins, PLOS Director of Publishing Operations.

“Dedicated sponsors like PLOS help ensure that MathJax is continuously developed”, comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax Manager. "Thanks to the support and feedback from the team at PLOS we can keep MathJax the powerful, high-quality rendering solution it is today."

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with PLOS, and welcomes their support for the MathJax project.
