[RedLink](http://www.redlink.com) is giving the MathJax project a boost by joining our sponsorship program as [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

RedLink helps academic publishers, editors, and libraries save time, engage readers, and streamline collaborations by providing innovative solutions that cut across platforms and help unite the scholarly ecosystem.

RedLink leverages MathJax on [Remarq® from RedLink](https://remarqable.com/app/index.html), the decentralized scholarly collaboration network that helps editors, authors, and publishers engage with their communities on their sites, on their terms. Remarq enables annotation of mathematics, images, and text, while also allowing researchers and experts to connect and collaborate via Groups and personal connections.

“MathJax provides important functionality for authors, researchers, and students, and we’re very happy to support their good work,” says Kent Anderson, RedLink’s CEO. “MathJax also represents collaboration and community, two main features of Remarq and RedLink’s own approach to problem-solving, so we’re proud to be involved on that level, as well.”

“Becoming a MathJax Supporter is a great example for RedLinks's commitment to providing the science community with reliable, flexible, and open technology," comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Their support helps ensure the continuous development of MathJax and enables RedLink to make optimal use of MathJax.”


The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with RedLink, and welcomes their support for the MathJax project.

**About MathJax**

MathJax was initiated in 2009 by the [American Mathematical Society (AMS)](http://www.ams.org),  [Design Science](http://www.dessci.com), and the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](http://www.siam.org) with the aim of developing a universal, robust, and easy-to-use solution to display mathematics on the web. MathJax's open source JavaScript library provides high-quality display on all browsers and platforms without the need for readers to install plugins or fonts. Using MathJax also enables copy&paste of equations and is compatible with accessibility tools for vision and learning disabilities. The MathJax Consortium is supported by numerous sponsors.
