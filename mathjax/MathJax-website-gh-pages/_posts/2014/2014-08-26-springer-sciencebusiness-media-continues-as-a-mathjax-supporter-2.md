[Springer Science+Business Media](http://www.springer.com/) continues to support MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

A leading global scientific publisher, Springer publishes 2,200 journals and over 8,000 new books each year. Over 240 open access journals on Springer’s open access platforms [Springer Open](http://www.springeropen.com/) and [BioMed Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com/) provide accessible, high-quality display of mathematical and scientific content using MathJax.

"The quality of our online publications are reliant on the accurate and readable display of mathematical equations.", says Rob Lloyd, Head of Front End, Springer London. "The work of the Mathjax team is vital to achieving this. We are proud to sponsor and engage with a team and a community that is dedicated to the advancement of the display of mathematics in the browser."

“Thanks to dedicated sponsors like Springer, we are able to develop MathJax continuously, keeping it the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “In addition to its financial support, Springer provides the MathJax team with productive feedback that helps our development.”

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with Springer and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
