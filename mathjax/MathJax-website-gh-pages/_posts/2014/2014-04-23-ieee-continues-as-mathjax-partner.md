[IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/), the world’s largest professional association, has renewed its support as a MathJax Partner, demonstrating its commitment to being a partner to the science community.

With roots going back to 1884, IEEE follows its mission to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.  From over 2,000 local chapters across the world, to more than 148 transactions, journals, and magazines to sponsoring over 1,300 conferences, IEEE inspires as global community in electrical engineering, computer science and electronics. Its [_IEEEXplore®_ digital library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) provides web access to over three million technical documents with more than eight million downloads each month.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IEEE, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
