[Oxford University Press](http://www.oup.com) (OUP) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

OUP, a department of [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), currently publishes over 6,000 titles in more than 40 languages each year worldwide. OUP's broad academic and educational spectrum includes dictionaries, journals, scholarly monographs, schoolbooks as well as higher education textbooks. [Oxford Journals](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/), publishes more than 300 scholarly journals in the humanities, social sciences, law, science, and medicine. Throughout its journals as well as online book products such as [Oxford Scholarship Online](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/), OUP delivers mathematics using MathJax, to ensure beautiful and accessible rendering on all platforms and devices.

Richard O’Beirne, Digital and Journals Strategy Manager, OUP, said: "Every year, we’re delivering over 2 million MathJax-enabled article downloads and that’s growing as we roll out MathJax display to more subject areas such as economics. MathJax just works seamlessly, and we’re delighted to renew OUP’s support of the MathJax Consortium in 2014."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with OUP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
