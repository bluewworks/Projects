The publishing program of CUP comprises of over 45,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries.

"Cambridge is providing more and more of its content digitally and MathJax helps us ensure that our key titles in Mathematics are well displayed." said Chris Fell, Digital Publishing Director at Cambridge University Press.

“As a MathJax sponsor, CUP provides the MathJax team with important support and feedback for our development,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “Thanks to dedicated sponsors like CUP, we can keep MathJax the high-quality, reliable, and flexible rendering solution it is today.”
