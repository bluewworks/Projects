[Taylor &amp; Francis](http://www.taylorandfrancisgroup.com/) is giving the MathJax project a boost by joining our sponsorship program as [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/). Taylor &amp; Francis, a division of [Informa plc](http://www.informa.com/), is a leading international academic publisher with roots reaching back to 1798.

Taylor &amp; Francis Group publishes more than 1,700 journals and over 3,600 new books each year, with a books backlist in excess of 50,000 specialist titles. [Taylor &amp; Francis Online](http://tandfonline.com) provides access to all journals from Taylor &amp; Francis, Routledge and Psychology Press, and will use MathJax to provide beautiful, accessible mathematics in publications such as the journals of the [American Statistical Association](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/). For the latest developments, follow T&amp;F Maths &amp; Stats [@tandfmaths](https://twitter.com/tandfmaths) on Twitter.

Richard Steele, an editorial director for mathematics &amp; statistics at Taylor &amp; Francis, noted “We are delighted to be able to support the MathJax project as it aims to develop a state-of-the-art, open source, JavaScript platform for display of mathematics, to the benefit of authors, readers, and publishers alike.”

Becoming a MathJax Supporter allows Taylor &amp; Francis to make optimal use of MathJax, and makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible and open technology for mathematics on the web.
