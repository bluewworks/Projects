The London Mathematical Society, ([LMS](http://lms.ac.uk/)) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Founded in 1865 for the promotion and extension of mathematical knowledge, the LMS supports mathematics and its research community through a diverse program of publishing, grants, meetings, and lecture programs. The LMS engages policy-makers on mathematics education and research, and participates in international mathematical initiatives for promoting the discipline.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with the LMS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
