[The Optical Society](http://www.osa.org) (OSA) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter. Through its 15 journals, OSA publishes optics and photonics content that is broad-based and covers many fields—from physics to engineering to biology to telecommunications and beyond.

The OSA began experimenting with MathJax on a small scale in 2010 and [Biomedical Optics Express](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/boe/home.cfm) (BOE). In May 2012, OSA began offering full-text HTML views of its primary journal articles using MathJax for displaying equations in HTML. "As we have encountered issues, the MathJax Team has been extremely responsive and generous in providing solutions. I think that there’s opportunity to make MathJax even more interactive and robust in a way that can add a lot of value to the online article experience", comments Scott Dineen.

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with OSA, and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project as well as their commitment to bringing high-quality mathematics to their online and mobile readers.
