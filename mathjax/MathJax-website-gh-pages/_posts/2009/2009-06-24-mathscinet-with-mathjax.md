The American Mathematical Society anticipates incorporating MathJax into MathSciNet (Mathematical Reviews on the Web) in the near future. MathSciNet is an electronic publication providing access to a carefully maintained and easily searchable database of reviews, abstracts and bibliographic information for much of the mathematical sciences literature. This database contains over 2 million items, and each year over 100,000 items from approximately 2000 publications are added to the database. It is a critical tool for researchers across the mathematical sciences worldwide. "The American Mathematical Society continually seeks to improve MathSciNet, and adopting MathJax for math display in HTML is a very promising enhancement", according to Graeme Fairweather, Executive Editor of Mathematical Reviews.
