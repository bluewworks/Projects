The American Mathematical Society [released an update](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/help/about.html) of MathSciNet using MathJax on October 12.  [MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html) is an easily searchable database of online reviews, abstracts and bibliographic information for much of the mathematical sciences literature.  With over two million items, and growing at a rate of over 100,000 items per year, MathSciNet is the largest-scale deployment of MathJax to date.  

MathSciNet, along with its older traditional paper edition, Math Reviews, is an essential tool for mathematical research.  MathJax is proud to be able to help make MathSciNet more accessible in more browsers with high-quality typesetting and less hassle than ever before.
