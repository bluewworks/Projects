MathJax today announced that the [American Statistical
Association](https://www.amstat.org/) is joining its sponsorship program as
a [MathJax Supporter](//www.mathjax.org/#sponsors).

The American Statistical Association (ASA) is the “Big Tent for
Statistics” as the world’s largest community of statisticians.  The ASA
was founded in Boston in 1839 making it the second-oldest, continuously
operating professional association in the United States.  The ASA supports
excellence in the development, application, and dissemination of
statistical science through meetings, publications, membership services,
education, accreditation, and advocacy.

Ronald L. Wasserstein, Executive Director of ASA notes that “The ASA is
committed to advancing and disseminating high quality research in
statistics.  MathJax helps assure our publications appear accurately across
platforms so that they can be viewed by researchers everywhere.”

“By becoming a MathJax sponsor, the ASA demonstrates its partnership to
the science community on the web”, comments Tom Blythe, MathJax
Consortium.  "Becoming a MathJax Supporter allows the ASA to make optimal
use of MathJax, and makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the
reliable, flexible, and open technology it is today.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with the ASA, and
welcomes its support for the MathJax project.
