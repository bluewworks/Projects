[The Mathematical Association of America (MAA)](http://www.maa.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The [MAA](http://www.maa.org) is the largest professional society focused on mathematics accessible at the collegiate level. As an early adopter of the web, the MAA has led the way communicating mathematics online including resources such as [MathDL](http://mathcomm.org/), [born-digital ebooks](http://www.maa.org/publications/ebooks/calculus-modeling-and-application-2nd-edition) and [journals](http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals). The MAA's open-source homework system [WeBWorK](http://webwork.maa.org/) is used at over [500 institutions worldwide](http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/WeBWorK_Sites#.UjkYtd_ZXZg).

"MathJax has made rendering mathematics easy – which is amazing – and it's an integral part of MAA's website," says Jim Angelo, MAA Director of Publications.  "The MAA is proud to be a sponsor of this innovative and groundbreaking application."

"The support of long term sponsors like the MAA allows us to continuously develop the high-quality, universal solution that MathJax has become over the past 5 years," says Peter Krautzberger, MathJax Manager. "The experience and leadership of the MAA in mathematical publishing and online technologies helps us improve MathJax for the benefit of the entire community."

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with the MAA and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
