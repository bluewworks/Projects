[Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Partner.

Stack Exchange's ever-growing network of online communities provides dedicated platforms that serve experts in a specific field. Among the 143 Stack Exchange sites, 29 integrate MathJax support to provide easy authoring and flawless rendering of mathematical content, including [Mathematics Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com) and [Physics Stack Exchange](http://physics.stackexchange.com) as well as new communities such as [History of Math and Science Stack Exchange](http://hsm.stackexchange.com/) and [Worldbuilding Stack Exchange](http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/).

"We're excited to continue our partnership with MathJax," said David Fullerton, Vice President of Engineering. "MathJax is an essential part of our math and science communities, and it keeps getting better every year. We look forward to continuing our work with them over the next year."

"MathJax development benefits greatly from Stack Exchange's support," comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "We are grateful to receive rich feedback from their technical team as well as the highly diverse Stack Exchange communities to ensure that MathJax continues to be flexible, open, and robust."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Stack Exchange, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
