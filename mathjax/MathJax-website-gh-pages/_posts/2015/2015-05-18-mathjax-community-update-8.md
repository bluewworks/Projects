It's been far too long since we shared all the great new stuff from around the MathJax community!

## News

[MathJax 2.5.3 is out](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/releases/tag/2.5.3). This patch releases should wrap up 2.5.x and we're making good progress on the [upcoming 2.6 release](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/milestones/MathJax%20v2.6).

We have also started the [MathJax semantic enrichment project](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/wiki/Semantic-Enrichment-project) -- watch out for a longer post on this coming soon!

Peter had a guest post over at [Wiley's Exchanges Blog](http://exchanges.wiley.com/blog/2015/03/02/making-math-and-science-first-class-citizens-on-the-web/).

Oh, and we also released [MathJax-node v0.3.0](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-node/releases/tag/0.3.0) so go grab it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/MathJax-node).

## Plugins and tools

Adobe Digital Editions added [MathML support on Windows](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/release-notes.html) using MathJax.

Check out [mathjax-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjax-server) for a small nodejs server built on MathJax-node.

You're using GitHub's Atom editor? There's a [Markdown+MathJax previewer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus) for that.

The markdown editor [Remarkable](https://web.archive.org/web/20150516041039/http://remarkableapp.net/) comes with out-of-the-box [MathJax support](https://web.archive.org/web/20150524154408/http://remarkableapp.net/screenshots.html).

The Chrome extension / markdown editor [Markdown Preview Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl) added MathJax support.

The slide-show tool [Gistdeck](https://gistdeck.github.io) now comes with [a MathJax extension](https://gistdeck.github.io/#14).

The web annotation platform [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) added [math input support](https://hypothes.is/blog/introducing-math/).

[mathjs](http://mathjs.org/index.html), the extensive math library for JS shared a nifty ["pretty printing" example](http://mathjs.org/examples/browser/pretty_printing_with_mathjax.html.html) using MathJax.

Sina Baharm created the nifty [MathInjector bookmarklet](https://github.com/sinabahram/MathInjector) to extract MathML from various elements on a page and insert it as raw MathML for assistive technologies to access.

[Mathgram](http://www.mathgram.com/) is web-based editor using LaTeX internally.

The code documentation generator [PAX](http://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax-world/) comes with [MathJax support](http://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax-world/mgl-pax-manual.html#toc-7-3-mathjax).

## Content and Demos

[@alexan0308](https://github.com/alexan0308) added [two demos to MathJax/MathJax-examples](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-examples/tree/master/advanced) for interacting with subexpressions.

[João Palhoto Matos](http://math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/professor?who=jmatos), Instituto Superior Técnico, shared his [multivariable calculus resources](http://cdi2tp.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) (in Portuguese).

[Ron Knott](http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/), Surrey University, has some great math resources such as [this page on exact values of trignometric function](http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/simpleTrig.html).

Jeremy Elson pointed us to his small but excellent [summary on calculating the expected value of a lottery jackpot](http://www.circlemud.org/jelson/megamillions/table-explanation.html).

Over on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com), a [guest post by Rajoshi Ghosh and Tanmai Gopal](https://css-tricks.com/tour-performant-responsive-css-site/) needs a bit of math to explain how to get a parallax effect in pure CSS.
