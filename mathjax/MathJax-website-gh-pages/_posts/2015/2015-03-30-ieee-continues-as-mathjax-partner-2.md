[IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Partner.

With roots going back to 1884, IEEE is the world’s largest professional association with over 2,000 local chapters across the world. IEEE follows its mission to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.  With more than 148 transactions, journals, and magazines as well as sponsoring for over 1,300 conferences, IEEE inspires as global community in electrical engineering, computer science and electronics. Its [_IEEEXplore®_ digital library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) provides web access to over three million technical documents with more than eight million downloads each month.

"Mathjax plays an integral role in our display of math on the web," said Gerry Grenier, Senior Director of Publishing Technologies. "The clarity and accuracy of our math is superb. We are enthusiastic members of the MathJax community."

“IEEE’s long-term support of MathJax, both financially and as an industry leader, gives MathJax a huge boost,” said Peter Krautzberger,  MathJax Manager. "The MathJax team benefits from suggestions from IEEE staff  ensuring that MathJax continues to push the envelope in publishing math and science on the web.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IEEE, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
