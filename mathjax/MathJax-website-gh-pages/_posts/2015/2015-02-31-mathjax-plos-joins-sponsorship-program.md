MathJax today announced that [PLOS](http://www.plos.org) (Public Library of Science) is joining its sponsorship program as a [MathJax Supporter](//www.mathjax.org/#supporters).

PLOS is a nonprofit publisher and advocacy organization founded to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. Since 2003, PLOS has launched 7 journals including innovative publications like PLOS ONE, PLOS Collections, and PLOS Currents. PLOS works to overcome unnecessary barriers to immediate availability of research, to optimize the quality and integrity of the publication process, and to develop innovative approaches to the assessment, organization and reuse of ideas and data.

“As an Open Access publisher and advocacy organization, PLOS is committed to supporting open systems for solving the challenges of scholarly communication.  We are proud to be working with MathJax to build a robust community for their project,” says John Chodacki, Product Director, PLOS.

“Becoming a MathJax Supporter is a great example for PLOS's commitment to providing the science community with reliable, flexible, and open technology," comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "It enables PLOS to make optimal use of MathJax and helps ensure the continuous development of MathJax.”

The MathJax team looks forward to the collaboration with PLOS, and welcomes their support for the MathJax project.
