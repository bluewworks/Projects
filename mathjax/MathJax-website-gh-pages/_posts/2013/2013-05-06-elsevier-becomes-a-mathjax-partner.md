We're happy to announce today that [Elsevier](http://www.elsevier.com), world-leading provider of scientific, technical and medical products and services, has become a [MathJax Partner](/#sponsors).

As one of the initial members of the MathJax sponsorship program, Elsevier has a long history of supporting MathJax's efforts towards making mathematical and scientific content a first-class citizen on the web. With the inclusion of MathJax on [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/), Elsevier has enabled one of the largest publishing platforms to provide mathematical and scientific content at the highest quality, using modern, open web standards.

"Elsevier's long term support has been invaluable to the MathJax project, past, present and future. Elsevier becoming a MathJax Partner is a great vote of confidence and we look forward to continuing our collaboration. The rich feedback and support we receive from our sponsors enables us to keep our bearing as we create a web where math and science are as much home as they are throughout education and research.", said Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager.

“The relationship we have formed with MathJax is a natural fit to our commitment to support initiatives that benefit authors, researchers and the mathematics community,” says Laura Hassink, Senior Vice President Physical Sciences at Elsevier. “We are delighted to expand our cooperation with MathJax.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with Elsevier, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
