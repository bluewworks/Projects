We're getting ready for the [Joint Mathematics Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) in San Diego! There's lots to do but we wanted to give you a few extra suggestions with a MathJax flavor.

*   **_UPDATED LOCATION_** **MathJax community meet up.** Meet up with MathJax team members on _Friday, between 3:30pm and 5pm_. We'll be on the upper floor. Since it's a bit chilly, we'll meet indoors by the Center Terrace (instead of outside) -- check the [Convention Center's floor plan](http://www.visitsandiego.com/facilityinformation/floorplans.cfm). Stop by and say hi!
*   **Session on The Present and Future of Mathematics on the Web** For the full schedule, see the [program page](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2013/2141_program_ss62.html).

    *   _1:30pm_ Davide Cervone, [MathJax from an Author's Point of View](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/amsmtgs/2141_abstracts/1086-97-2273.pdf).
    *   _5:30pm_ Tom Leathrum, [Emerging Standards in Electronic Math Publishing](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/amsmtgs/2141_abstracts/1086-00-2008.pdf).

*   **Exhibition area**

    *   Peter Krautzberger will be at the AMS booth on _Wednesday, 1-3pm, Saturday 10-12pm_ to talk about all things MathJax -- from blogs to apps to publishing workflows. You can also reach Peter [via email](mailto:peter.krautzbeger@mathjax.org).

*   If you **spot MathJax at the JMM**, be sure to let us know on twitter [@mathjax](http://www.twitter.com/mathjax) [#jmm13](http://twitter.com/search/jmm13)!
