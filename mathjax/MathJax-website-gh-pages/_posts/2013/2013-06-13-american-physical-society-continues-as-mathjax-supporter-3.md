The American Physical Society ([APS](http://www.aps.org/)) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter. As one of the original [MathJax sponsors](/sponsors/), APS's commitment is an important part of the long term success of the project.

Representing over 50,000 members, including physicists in academia, national laboratories and industry in the United States and throughout the world, APS is the largest society of professional physicists in the US. APS is involved in several activities to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics including a strong publication program with landmark titles such as Physical Review Letters, the Physical Review journals, and Reviews of Modern Physics. APS has been an early proponent of new technologies and standards for electronic publication of mathematical content, and one of the first major scholarly publishers to embrace the MathML standards for mathematics.

"APS will be launching fully text HTML versions of our articles later this year for the first time. MathJax is the key technology that is enabling us to finally do this in a superior manner that we expect will meet the high expectations of our journal readers. We continue to be excited about the rapid development of MathJax and our ongoing collaboration with the team." comments Mark Doyle, Director, Journal Information Systems, APS.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with APS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
