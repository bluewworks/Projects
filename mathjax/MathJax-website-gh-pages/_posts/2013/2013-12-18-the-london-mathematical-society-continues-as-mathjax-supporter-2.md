The [London Mathematical Society](http://lms.ac.uk/) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

As the  United Kingdom's learned society for mathematics, the London Mathematical Society offers a rich publishing program, provides a diverse grant program and organizes scientific meetings and lectures. Beyond that, the LMS is involved in policy and strategic work to support mathematics and the mathematics research community as a whole.

"The LMS welcomes MathJax as a new publishing format and we have been impressed with the capabilities of MathJax to render mathematics on-screen", said Fiona Nixon, Executive Secretary of the LMS. "The Society is making good progress in introducing full-text HTML with MathJax to its journals, with the first published papers expected online in early 2014."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with the LMS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
