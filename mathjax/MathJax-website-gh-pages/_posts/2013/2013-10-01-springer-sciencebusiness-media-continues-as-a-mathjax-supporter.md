MathJax is pleased to announce that [Springer Science+Business Media](http://www.springer.com/) has renewed its sponsorship of the MathJax project as a [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/#supporters).

Springer is a leading global scientific publisher, publishing 2,200 journals and over 9,000 new books each year. Most prominently, Springer’s open access platform [BioMed Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com/) and [Springer Open](http://www.springeropen.com/) deploy MathJax to provide accessible, high-quality display of mathematical and scientific content in standards-driven HTML.

“MathJax is the best method we have found for rendering math, supporting both MathML and LaTeX input. Due to the flexibility of LaTeX, we continue to push MathJax to its limits, so we are happy to help the further development and maintenance of this great tool!” Brian Bishop, VP Platform Development Springer-SBM

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with Springer and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
