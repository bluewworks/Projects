[The MathWorks](http://www.mathworks.com) is giving the MathJax project a boost by joining our sponsorship program as [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/#supporters). As a leading developer of mathematical computing software MathWorks helps engineers and scientists worldwide to accelerate the pace of discovery, innovation, and development.

The MathWorks's core products -- [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and [Simulink](http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/) -- are used throughout the automotive, aerospace, communications, electronics, and industrial automation industries as well as increasingly technical fields, such as financial services and computational biology. In addition to providing the fundamental tools for research and development, more than 5000 colleges and universities around the world use the same tools for teaching and research in a broad range of technical disciplines.

“MathWorks is proud to support this important initiative,” said Cleve Moler, chief mathematician and co-founder of MathWorks. “MathJax enables more people to harness the power of mathematics using the web, and we are pleased to contribute to its continued growth.”

Becoming a MathJax Supporter enables MathWorks to make optimal use of MathJax, and makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible and open technology for mathematics on the web.
