[AIP Publishing](https://publishing.aip.org/), a division of the American Institute of Physics, has renewed its support as a MathJax Partner, demonstrating its commitment to being a partner to the science community.

[The American Institute of Physics](http://aip.org/) is an organization of 10 physical science societies, representing more than 135,000 scientists, engineers, and educators and is one of the world’s largest publishers of scientific information in physics. AIP pursues innovation in electronic publishing of scholarly journals and offers full-solution publishing services for its Member Societies. AIP publishes 16 journals; two magazines, including its flagship publication [Physics Today](http://www.physicstoday.org/); and the [AIP Conference Proceedings series](http://proceedings.aip.org/).

“Clarity and accuracy of mathematical equations is an absolute necessity in effectively communicating scientific research findings,” said AIP Publishing Chief Information Officer Evan Owens.  “As such, AIP Publishing sees its support of the MathJax initiative as a key partnership for helping our author and reader communities advance their scientific endeavors.”

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with AIP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
