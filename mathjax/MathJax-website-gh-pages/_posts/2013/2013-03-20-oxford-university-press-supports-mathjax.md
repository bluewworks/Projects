Oxford University Press ([OUP](http://www.oup.com)) is boosting MathJax by joining our sponsorship program as MathJax Supporter. OUP, a department of [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), is the largest university press in the world with roots reaching back to the 1470s.

OUP currently publishes over 6,000 titles a year worldwide, including dictionaries, journals, scholarly monographs, schoolbooks as well as higher education textbooks. [Oxford Journals](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/), publishes more than 300 scholarly journals, using MathJax to deliver beautiful, accessible mathematics in journals such as the  [Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/) and [Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics](http://ptep.oxfordjournals.org/), as well as online book products such as [Oxford Scholarship Online](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/).

Richard O’Beirne, Digital and Journals Strategy Manager, OUP, said: "We’re delighted to become a MathJax Supporter. MathJax has quietly revolutionized mathematics display in digital products, and integrates seamlessly with author and publishing workflows."

Becoming a MathJax Supporter helps OUP to make optimal use of MathJax, and makes an important contribution to keeping MathJax the reliable, flexible and open technology it is today.
