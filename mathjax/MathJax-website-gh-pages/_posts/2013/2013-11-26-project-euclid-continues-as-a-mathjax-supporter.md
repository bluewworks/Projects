[Project Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

Project Euclid, jointly managed by [Cornell University Library](https://www.library.cornell.edu/) and [Duke University Press](http://www.dukeupress.edu/), addresses the unique needs of independent and society journals. Through a collaborative partnership arrangement, these publishers join forces to create a vibrant online information community for independent and society journals. Project Euclid has been an early MathJax supporter as well as large-scale adopter of MathJax, providing native, high quality, and accessible mathematics for its readers.

"Project Euclid is delighted to continue its support of MathJax,‚Äù said Mira Waller, Project Euclid Manager at Duke University Press. "We are pleased to have expanded MathJax's presence on Project Euclid's soon-to-be-launched new site, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with MathJax to enhance and further develop the experience of math online."

The MathJax team looks forward to the continued collaboration with Project Euclid, and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
