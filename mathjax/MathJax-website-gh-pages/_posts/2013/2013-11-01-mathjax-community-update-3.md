While [MathJax v2.3-beta](http://www.mathjax.org/mathjax-v2-3-beta-now-available/) is running smoothly, there news from around the MathJax community keeps coming in. So let's catch up a little!

### Blog post at O'Reilly Programming

In houshold news, Peter has written [a post for O'Reilly's Programming blog](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/11/mathml-forges-on.html) about the state of MathML on the web. Go check it out.

### The arXiv.org adds MathJax support

The well-known preprint server [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) has [added MathJax rendering to abstract pages](http://arxiv.org/help/mathjax/). We are thrilled to help improve the life of the arXiv's community!

### MathJax v2.3-beta webfonts playground

The ever-productive [Christian Perfect has created a nice playground](http://checkmyworking.com/misc/MathJax-play-area/) for exploring our new webfonts options in v2.3-beta. Go and play and [let us know](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues?direction=desc&amp;sort=updated&amp;state=open) if you find bugs or typographical inconsistencies.

### Knockout binding handlers for MathJax

Thanks to the very same Christian Perfect, you can grab an easy to digest [example of binding handlers](https://github.com/christianp/knockout-mathjax-bindings) to typeset content using MathJax in a [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) setting.

### MathJax support for Ghost

It's barely publicly available and already the kickstarter-funded, open-source blogging platform [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) can offer you MathJax support -- thanks to this [tutorial by Feynman Liang](http://feynmanliang.com/mathjax-integration/), improving a solution by Patrick Edelman.

### MDwiki adds MathJax support

The single-page, markdown-driven [MDwiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/) now offers [out of the box MathJax support](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!gimmicks.md).

### OERpub textbook editor improves

OERpub keeps improving its open-source, HTML5 textbook editor. You can catch up on the latest improvements by reading [Kathi Fletcher's blog post](http://kefletcher.blogspot.com/2013/09/more-about-textbook-editor.html), [watch her presentation at Books in Browsers 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOMBeq7H1A4) last week, or go ahead and [grab the code on github](https://github.com/oerpub/github-bookeditor).

### AAP's EPUB 3 Implementation Project -- White Paper is now online

Over the summer we contributed our expertise on math on the web and in ebooks to the [AAP's intiative](https://web.archive.org/web/20150329081435/http://publishers.org/epub3implementationproject/) to move the implementation of EPUB3 forward. The [white paper has now been published](https://web.archive.org/web/20150330160835/http://www.publishers.org/press/117/). The project is an important step towards better digital books and reading systems by bridging the gap between publishers, reading systems and standards groups.

### NAG Toolbox for MATLAB documentation adds MathJax support

NAG takes advantage of MATLAB's updated browser environment. This allows MathJax-integration into the documentation, a great improvement over the old rendering. [Read up on the details at the NAG blog](http://blog.nag.com/2013/09/nag-toolbox-for-matlab-documentation.html).

Thanks everyone!
