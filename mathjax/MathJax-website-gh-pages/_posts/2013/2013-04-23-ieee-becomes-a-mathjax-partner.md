[IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/), the world’s largest professional association, has announced today it has become a [MathJax Partner](/#sponsors), becoming one of a select group of technical publishers that play an active role in the development and support of MathJax.

With 425,000 members in over 160 countries, IEEE fosters technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. IEEE publishes nearly a third of the world’s technical literature in electrical engineering, computer science and electronics, including more than 160 transactions, journals and magazines. Through its [_IEEEXplore®_ digital library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/), IEEE provides subscribers over three million technical documents including research articles, standards, and conference publications.

"IEEE’s support of MathJax, both financially and as an industry leader, is a huge boost to the project,” said Peter Krautzberger,  MathJax Manager. "MathJax has already greatly benefited from suggestions from IEEE technical staff that have had the opportunity to interact with the tool, and we welcome their ongoing support. Together we can ensure that mathematical content continues its path towards becoming a first class citizen on the web.”

“IEEE is excited to strengthen our commitment to the MathJax effort. This joint collaboration will help increase awareness for MathJax and help us ensure that the quality of published mathematical, technical and scientific content continues to improve”, said Gerry Grenier,  IEEE Senior Director of Publishing Technologies.
