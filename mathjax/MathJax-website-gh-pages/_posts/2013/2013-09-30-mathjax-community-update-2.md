We've been a bit quiet, working hard on the v2.3 release. But thankfully there's plenty of great stuff coming from our community so here are a few cool things we've come across in the past few weeks.

### Blackboard video tutorial

David Gibson at Blackboard has produced a [video tutorial for integrating MathJax in Blackboard Learn 9.1 SP10+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPKK-7U6PMU&amp;feature=youtu.be).

### TexPaste

If you haven't seen it on Hacker News already, [TexPaste](http://www.texpaste.com/) is a new pastebin-like app with some wysiwyg functionality.

### Vision Objects updates

Vision Objects has updated [its awesome handwriting webdemo](http://webdemo.myscript.com/#/demo/equation) (integrating Desmos) and released [MyScript MathPad](https://itunes.apple.com/app/myscript-mathpad/id674996719) for iOS (free with in-app purchases). Its technology is also used in another iOS app, [Math Ink](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/math-ink/id596393352).

### Lectures on the web

Quite a buzz came from Michael Gottlieb's wonderful HTML5 edition of [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/). And if you want to learn the principles of finite deformation continuum mechanics, check out [Bob McGinty's excellent text](http://www.continuummechanics.org/cm/index.html).

### Neo4j GraphGists add MathJax support

The graph databases experts at Neo4j have added MathJax support into [their GraphGist viewer](http://gist.neo4j.org/) so go ahead and [check out this example](http://gist.neo4j.org/?6725918) and check out [their awesome examples](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist/wiki#examples) in general.

### Inkling adds MathJax support

Publishing startup [Inkling](http://www.inkling.com) added MathJax support (both TeX and MathML input) to its authoring platform [Inkling Habitat](https://www.inkling.com/habitat/).

### Writing Kit with MathJax keyboard

The iOS app [Writing Kit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writing-kit-research-write/id426208994?mt=8) now comes with a [dedicated MathJax keyboard](https://twitter.com/writingkit/status/380505820263227394) for easier input.

### ChromeVox team at GD

Google's ChromeVox team sat down and recorded an [excellent video for Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/live/shows/5881057312243712) bringing you up to speed to the new enhancements coming to ChromeVox soon.

### Meet Fred at Mozilla Summit

Last but very much not least, our own Fred Wang is heading to the [Mozilla Summit](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2013) this week. You can get a sneak peek at [his slides over on github](http://fred-wang.github.io/MozSummitMathML/) (Firefox required).

Thanks everyone!
