[Project Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org) has renewed its support for the MathJax project for another year. Project Euclid was an early supporter and large-scale adopter of MathJax for use in scholarly publishing, so its continued support for the project is a welcome vote of confidence. "MathJax is transforming the way we display math in Project Euclid," says Mira Waller, Project Euclid Manager, "without installing anything on their browsers, our users can now enjoy cleanly displayed mathematics."

Project Euclid, jointly managed by Cornell and the Duke University Press, addresses the unique needs of low-cost independent and society journals. Through a collaborative partnership arrangement, these publishers join forces and participate in an online presence with advanced functionality, without sacrificing their intellectual or economic independence or commitment to low subscription prices. Mathematics display in titles and abstracts via MathJax, full-text searching, reference linking, making collection metadata available through the Open Archives Initiative, and long-term retention of data are all important components of the project.
