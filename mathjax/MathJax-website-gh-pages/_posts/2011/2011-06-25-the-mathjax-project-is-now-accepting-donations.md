We have received requests from the MathJax community to accept donations in amounts less than those required by our [Sponsorship program](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/mathjax-sponsorship-program/). In response we have added a Pledgie button to the MathJax home page, [www.mathjax.org](http://www.mathjax.org). Your contributions will help us continue to provide our popular CDN service, browser testing, prompt bug fixing, and new functionality and help ensure that MathJax will provide rock-solid mathematics display for your content and the enjoyment of your readers. Your help is much appreciated.
