The American Physical Society ([APS](http://www.aps.org)) has announced that it will continue its support for the MathJax project for another year. APS was one of first organizations to become a [MathJax Supporter](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/mathjax-sponsorship-program/), and is now one of the first to renew. The announcement represents an important milestone for MathJax, since support of organizations like APS over time is key to ensuring the projectâ€™s long-term success.

The largest society of professional physicists in the US, APS is involved in several activities to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics. This includes a strong publication program with landmark titles such as Physical Review Letters, the Physical Review journals, and Reviews of Modern Physics. APS has been an early proponent of new technologies and standards for electronic publication of mathematical content. It was one of the first major scholarly publishers to embrace the MathML standards for mathematics.

Mark Doyle, Assistant Director, Journal Information Systems, comments: "For many years, APS has been anticipating the arrival of a high-quality, open, browser-independent way of rendering mathematics on the web. MathJax is a significant step toward meeting this goal and APS will begin incorporating MathJax into our online products in the near future. More importantly, we look forward to working closely with the MathJax team on meeting the challenges posed by the highly complex math typesetting required for some of our journals."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with APS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
