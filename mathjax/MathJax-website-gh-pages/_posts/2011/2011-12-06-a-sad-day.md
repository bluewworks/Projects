Robert Miner, MathJax Project Director, passed away this morning from liver cancer. I have worked closely with Robert for about 15 years and considered him a close personal friend. I worked with him on virtually a daily basis here at Design Science for most of those years. I am sure many of you reading this also knew him as one of the most friendly and open people around. Our condolences go out to his wife and son. We will miss

him greatly.
