[The Annals of Mathematics ](http://annals.math.princeton.edu) and [Biomedical Optics Express](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/boe/home.cfm), two leading journals in their own domains, are now using MathJax for math display. There are some noteworthy differences between the two implementations, demonstrating how MathJax can be tailored to different digital environments and specific user needs. Interestingly, the two journals together nicely illustrate the long history of journal publishing and the move into the digital age.

With a rich history dating back to 1884, _The Annals of Mathematics_ is a landmark title, and widely considered as one of the foremost journals in mathematics. The Annals is published by the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University, with the cooperation of the Institute for Advanced Study, on a bimonthly basis.

The Annals of Mathematics portal website uses MathJax to display mathematical expressions in abstracts, titles and metadata from TeX source. The default MathJax menu is accessible by right-clicking on an equation, which allows the user to copy an equation or to modify its appearance. For an example, please take a look at the [January 2011](http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2011/173-1) issue.

_Biomedical Optics Express_ is the premier open-access, rapid-publication outlet of The Optical Society for the biomedical optics community.  It features online peer-reviewed articles in optics, photonics and imaging in the life sciences.

Taking advantage of the opportunities of online publishing, the journal offers authors the ability to include interactive visualization and analysis of datasets (with Interactive Science Publishing), and uses MathJax to display mathematical expressions throughout full-text articles. The Optical Society has taken advantage of the possibility to customize MathJax and integrate it into an existing framework. The implementation is fully MathML-based, has a customized initialization routine, and disables the default MathJax menu.
