IEEE, the worldâ€™s largest professional association, gave the MathJax project a boost last month when it joined the ranks of sponsoring organizations as a MathJax Supporter.  Beyond the welcome financial support, we are very pleased to have the benefit of IEEE's extensive experience and leadership in making scientific information available in electronic form.

The IEEE Xplore Digital Library provides access to over three million documents including research articles, standards, transactions and conference publications. MathJax has already greatly benefited from suggestions and bug reports from IEEE technical staff investigating the performance of MathJax with that trove of real-world technical content, and we look forward to further collaboration.

For over a century, IEEE has been dedicated to advancing technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. IEEE and its members inspire a global community through IEEE's highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities.
